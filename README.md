Context

This project was part of the Odin Project's challenges, the task was to create a rock, paper, scissors game that plays five rounds, 
tallies them and declares a winner based on the score. The outcomes can be viewed from the developer console.

Approach

Functions were created to generate the computer's choice using math.random and to receieve input as a string for the player's choice which is validated.
A function with a series of if statements was used to set the conditions for winning and losing.
Finally all of these functions were put inside a game function which tallied the results and plays the game five times at which point a winner is declared.
